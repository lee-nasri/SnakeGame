This repository contain source code of final project which is a part of a Embedded System Laboratory course offered by department of computer engineering, Chulalongkorn University (2019).

## Assignment

  Microcontroller is being used in wide variety of applications mostly when we require reliability, precise timing,
with limitted user interaction. Typical final projct would be a group project aiming for you to learn and
create such applications for microcontroller.

  However, due to difficult circumstance in demonstration of those like in previous years, we are asking
you to implement an application using microcontroller with the following requirements:

1. Make use of serial terminal, through UART to create an interactive application or game through the
use of console (ascii)

2. The application can be controlled through a serial terminal

3. Depending on your application, the “screen” is refreshed in time interval or through UART interrupt.
However, during the “refreshing”, it must still accept input through keybaord.

4. The screen may consist of 80 × 25 character or more. If your application is interactive, you may try to
increate the baudrate.

Your task is not to create a complete program, but it must be in a useable to the point where we can
test the requirement above.
